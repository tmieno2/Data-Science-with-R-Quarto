In order to calculate 12, you do not need to use the result of 22 or any other squares.\nEmbarrassingly parallel processes are very easy to parallelize because you do not have to worry about which process to complete first to make other processes happen.\nFortunately, most of the processes you are interested in parallelizing fall under this category\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the future_lapply() function from the future.apply package for parallelization.\nUsing the package, parallelization is a piece of cake as it is basically the same syntactically as lapply().\n\n\n#--- install the package ---#\ninstall.packages(future.apply) \n\n#--- load packages ---#\nlibrary(future.apply)\n\n\nHow\nYou can simply replace lapply() with future_lapply()!\n\n#--- parallelized ---#\nsq_ls &lt;- lapply(1:1000, function(x) x^2) \n\n#--- not parallelized ---#\nsq_ls_par &lt;- future_lapply(1:1000, function(x) x^2) \n\n\n\nYou can find out how many cores you have available for parallel computation on your computer using the detectCores() function from the parallel package.\n\n#--- number of all cores ---#\nparallel::detectCores()\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n\nBefore we implement parallelized lapply(), we need to declare what backend process we will be using by plan().\n\nplan(multicore, workers = parallel::detectCores() - 1)\n\n\nOther backend processes are:\n\nsequential: this is just a regular loop\nmulticore: forked sessions (not available on Windows)\nmultisession: multiple sessions (less performant thana multicore)\n\nWith the multicore option, R figure out which multicore or multisession should be used (or can be used) and automatically redirect the backend process to the appropriate (available) one.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nUnless you tell R explicitly to parallelize things (like using future_lapply()), R always uses a single core by default. So, you do not have to change anything manually when you do not want to use multiple cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsq_ls &lt;- future_lapply(1:1000, function(x) x^2)\n\n\n\n\nmicrobenchmark(\n\n  #--- parallelized ---#\n  \"parallelized\" = { sq_ls &lt;- future_lapply(1:1000, function(x) x^2) }, \n\n  #--- non-parallelized ---#\n  \"not parallelized\" = { sq_ls &lt;- lapply(1:1000, function(x) x^2) },\n  times = 100, \n  unit = \"ms\"\n\n) \n\nUnit: milliseconds\n             expr        min         lq       mean      median        uq\n     parallelized 214.475455 252.632071 288.473396 278.4967715 321.18057\n not parallelized   0.579383   0.742785   1.089473   0.8525375   1.15469\n       max neval\n 467.03261   100\n   7.06664   100\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because communicating jobs to each core takes some time as well.\nSo, if each of the iterative processes is super fast (like this example where you just square a number), the time spent on communicating with the cores outweighs the time saving due to parallel computation.\nParallelization is more beneficial when each of the repetitive processes takes long."

The only thing you did by group_by() was to tell R that whatever we will do to the new dataset is going to be done by group, which is reflected in “Groups” of the printed data.\n\n\nOnce the group is set, we are ready to do some group-wise (by carrier) operations. Let’s now find the means of arr_delay by carrier so we know which carriers perform better than others. We can do so using summarize().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nUsing the piping operator,\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can apply any functions that work on a vector (a variable)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nYou can assign the results of the grouped operations to new variables using mutate()\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nExercise 1InstructionExercise 2Exercise 3\n\n\nFind the carrier that had the longest average departure delay (dep_delay) during May through August.

Caching can be done by adding cache==TRUE as a chunk option.\nBy adding the option, once an R chunk is processed, its results are saved and can be reused again by R later when you compile the document again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\n\n\n\nChange eval: false to eval: true in the cache_1 chunk\nRender and confirm that sample_qmd_cache and sample_qmd_files folders are created\nRender again and observe that the rendering process is much faster now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen any part of the R codes within a cached R code chunk is changed, R is smart enough to recognize the change and evaluate the R code chunk again without using the cached results for the chunk.\n\n\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nChange y = 1 + x + v to y = 1 + 2 * x +v in the cache_1 chunk and render\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, your R codes within an cached R code chunk have not changed, but the content of a dataset used in the R code chunk may have changed.\nIn such a case, R is unable to recognize the change in the  content  of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\n\n\n\nChange eval: false to eval: true in the cache_2 chunk and render\nChange y = 1 + 2 * x + v back to y = 1 + x +v and render (notice that the printed number from cache_2 did not change)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo R, everything in the cache_2 chunk looks the same as they only look at the code texts, but not the contents of R objects.\nTherefore, R would call up the saved results instead of rerunning the R codes, which is not what you want.\nYou can use the dependson option to make R recognize any changes in cached R objects\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nAdd dependson: cache_1 to the cache_2 chunk as an option and render again."

Clearly, all the subsequent actions dependent on the dataset will not run.\n\n\n\nTo avoid errors in reading files, there are three options:\n\nOption 1 (recommended for a beginner)\nPut all the datasets you intend to use in the same directory in which your qmd file is located.\n\nOption 2\nIf the file is not in the directory, supply the full path to the file like this\n\nread.csv(\"~/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/Data-Science-with-R-Quarto/Chapter-2-Quarto/corn_price.csv\")\n\n\nOption 3\nTell R to look for a specific directory for datasets by setting a working directory using opts_knit$set(root.dir = directory) at the beginning by adding the code like below in your qmd file after the YAML header:\n```{r}\nknir::opts_knit$set(root.dir = \"~/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/Data-Science-with-R/Chapter-2-Quarto\")\n```"

The R software is used throughout the course. In order to achieve the goal, students will be introduced to the basics of programming and how to apply it to real world issues in the field of agricultural (agricultural economics, agronomy, etc) and environmental sciences. By completing the course, students will know data wrangling (e.g., merging, transforming datasets), data visualization, and exploratory data analysis, spatial data management.\n\n\nReading Materials\n\nRecommended:\n\nGrolemund, Garrett. and Wickham, Hadley. 2019 \nLovelace, Robin., Nowosad, Jakub., and Muenchow, Jannes. 2019 \n\nPrerequisites:\n\nIntroductory statistics (STAT 218) or equivalent\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\ntitlescoreAssignments (3 assignments)60%Final Paper40%Total100%\n\n\n\nAssignments: There will be 3 assignments. Late submissions will have 1/3 of a letter grade deducted from the grade for that submission, increasing by an additional 1/3 grade for each 24 hours beyond the deadline.\nFinal Paper: In this assignment, you write a paper with a particular emphasis on programming using real-world data sets. You must identify a topic that would involve collecting datasets from multiple different data sources. The topic has to be approved by me to avoid a final project without significant programming tasks by . The proposal of your final project detailing what datasets to use, where you collect them, and how you use them have to be submitted by .\n\n\n\nImportant Deadlines:\n\nFinal project topic approved by the instructor: October 30\nFinal project proposal: November 13\nFinal project submission: December 20\n\n\n\nTopics Covered\n\nIntroduction to R\nQuarto\nData Wrangling\nMerge and reshape datasets\nData visualization\nMiscellaneous data manipulations\nHow to write and organize codes\nResearch flow illustration\nWriting your own function\nLooping\nParallel computing\nCreate tables\nSpatial data\nWriting reproducible articles\n\n\n\nAcademic Honesty:\nStudents are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic dishonesty outlined in Section 4.2 of University’s Student Code of Conduct. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor for clarification of these guidelines if they have questions or concerns. The Department of Agricultural Economics has a written policy defining academic dishonesty, the potential sanctions for incidents of academic dishonesty, and the appeal process for students facing potential sanctions. The Department also has a policy regarding potential appeals of final course grades. These policies are available for review on the department’s website\n\n\nStudents with disabilities:\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY."

So, the R code looks more like this:\n\n\ncorn_yield &lt;- read.csv(\"corn_yields.csv\")\n\n\n\nThis will save us from writing out the full path every time we either import or export datasets.\nYou can do so by designating the directory as the working directory.\nOnce the working directory is set, R looks for files in that directory unless told otherwise.\nIt is not just when importing datasets. When you export an R object as a file, R will create a file in the working directory by default.\n\n\n\nYou can use setwd() to designate a directory as the working directory:\n\n#--- Setting a directory (path) in your computer---#\nsetwd(\"/Users/tmieno2/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/Data-Science-with-R-Quarto/Lectures/Chapter-3-DataWrangling\")\n\n\nYou can check the current working directory using the getwd() function:\n\n#--- find the current working directory ---#\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/tmieno2/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/Data-Science-with-R-Quarto/lectures/Chapter-3-DataWrangling\"\n\n\n\n\nSuppose it is convenient for you to set the working directory somewhere else than the folder where all the datasets are residing.\n\nsetwd(\"~/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/DataScience\")\n\n\nYou can then provide the path to the file relative to the working directory like this:\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Datasets/Chapter_3_data_wrangling/corn_yields.csv\")\n\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Dropbox/TeachingUNL/DataScience/Datasets/Chapter_3_data_wrangling/corn_yields.csv\")\n\n\nYou can use .. to move up a folder.
