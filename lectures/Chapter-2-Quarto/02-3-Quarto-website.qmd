## Get Started

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Start with a template

We are going to start with a Quarto website template and then modify it to our likings.

+ Open a terminal app or go to the terminal tab of the console pane.
+ Navigate to the folder in which you want to create a folder with all the website materials using `cd`.
+ Run the following code and you will see a series of questions. One of them ask you the name of the folder created. Say yes to all the other questions.

```console
quarto use template EmilHvitfeldt/website-template
```

<br>

Once the code is run, you should see files like below:

### Build a website

+ Click on the `Build` tab of the right upper pane and click on the **Render Website** button.

+ You will be then taken to the website (not online yet) of your default web-browser.

### index.qmd

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### What?

The **index.qmd** file directly under the project folder will turn into the index.html, which is the home of the website.

As you can see below, you configure things like title, subtitle, etc.

#### Try yourself

Change the title and subtitle, build a website, and then confirm how the website changed.

### _quarto.yml

In the `_quarto.yml` file, you can specify things like website navigation under the `website:` option, change the aesthetics of the website (under the `format:` option).

## Create a page

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Introduction

You can create a page on your website with a qmd file (and yml).

:::{.callout-note title="Important"}
When you build a website (by hitting the **Render website** button on RStudio), all the qmd files will be processed to be part of the website.
